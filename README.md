# Background Info
Food4Kids Waterloo Region delivers food packages to vulnerable children when they are not in school (more information here: https://food4kidswr.ca/). 
The delivery routes are made manually which can take several hours to form. Therefore, this program uses the travelling salesman problem to find the shortest possible route to each child's home helping both the drivers and the people at the orginization by saving hours of time. 

# How This Works
1. Drivers input the desitinations as a postal code into a spreadsheet
2. The program calculates the shortest distances of each route, compares them, and outputs the path that will be the shortest (hence most optimal route).
3. The user will recieve a list of addresses in order
